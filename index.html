                <p>I am Irene Yang, I am currently studying Information Technology at York University. The reason why I am studying information technology is because I wanted to learn more about coding in various languages, understanding what data is and how to store and retrieve it, and how to manage web servers.
                </p>
                <p>I am experienced in various computer programming languagues, including ones for web design, such as HTML, CSS, PHP, AJAX, and I have also worked with some web frameworks such as Python Flask and Xampp.</p>

              <p>
                ​I have designed a simple matchmaking dating application during a group project in one of my previous classes. During the assignment, we were tasked with making a program that used a score-based matchmaking algorithm. Moreover, we had to design and create an appropriate logo, a slogan, and the user interface. We decided to name the application as “Twine”, and the
                slogan was "A place to finally tie the knot".

                I also have created a printed circuit board (PCB) miniature piano. This was a solo
project, and thus I had to research myself on the parts to use (such as various types of resistors and other circuit parts) and how to acquire them. I also learned how to safely create the mini piano with the acquired parts.

                  For this project, I will be showing how to send requests to mongoDB to retrieve questions, then send those questions to ChatGPT to receive an answer. MongoDB is a NoSQL database
                  that uses documents similarly to JSON to store its data. I will be using mongoose to create a connection to MongoDB and be able to retrieve the data within its collections. Afterwards,
                  this data will be sent to ChatGPT using axios to make HTTP requests from node.js. In the section below, I will show the average response times and accuracy of ChatGPT.

              <p>
                <b>Research Approach:</b> Here I will be describing the tools used for this assignment.
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. MongoDB:</b> A non-relaional (NoSQL) database management system that uses JSON-like documents to store and manage data.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Node.js:</b> Used for server-side scripting. It also provides NPM as a package manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Express.js:</b> A minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies server creation, routing, and allows use of middleware. 
                  It is the backbone for many web applications and RESTful APIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. NPM (Node Package Manager):</b> Package manager for Node.js, assists with discovery, installation, and management of javascript packages. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Mongoose:</b> Object Data Modelling library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data and provides schema validation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Axios:</b> Promise-based HTTP Client for Node.js. It allows the user to make HTTP requests from node.js, such as fetching data from a database.
                  It also performs error handling for the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Xlsx:</b> This was used to upload questions and answers from an Excel sheet onto MongoDB directly.
                </p>

            <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The dataset used for this project consists of several questions relating to history, social science, and computer security. There will be approximately 50 questions per category. 
              The data originally
              is in multiple choice format, however, I will still be asking ChatGPT some of these questions to determine how accurate its various answers can be, or how it 
              handles these situations.

                    <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
    <p><b>Social Science: </b>ChatGPT seems to struggle with answering social science questions accurately. This may be due to social science topics having more complex theories and interpretations
      and a lack of definitive answers. 
    </p>
    <p><b>History: </b>ChatGPT seems to take longer on history questions, likely due to the longer responses that it generates, as history questions tend to require more information to answer. 
      It is also more accurate in history questions as information on history is documented and easier to verify.
    </p>
    <p><b>Computer Security: </b>ChatGPT was fastest to respond to computer security questions, likely due to computer security having defined principles that are easier to explain in shorter terms.
      The information on computer security is also more recent and more easily accessable in comparison to history and social science.
    </p>
    <h3>Overall:</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT was approximately 60% accurate in its answers. Its response time is around 1 second per question. ChatGPT4 was interestingly slower than ChatGPT3.5, likely due to
      attempting to respond with longer answers.
    </p>
    <h3>Concluding Remarks:</h3>
    <p>It was interesting to learn how to connect MongoDB and ChatGPT. Underestanding the Schema to update the database was complicated for me as I struggled to use
      mongoose. An improvement I would like to have for next time is to figure out a better way to upload questions and answers into the database.
